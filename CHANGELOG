cntt 0.4 (2023 ?? ??)
---------------------------

* Changed
  - The CNT constructor now takes the ksteps and symmetry parameters
  - The <calculateCuttingLines> method has been replaced with the <setKSteps> method
  - Labelling bands has been removed. CNT objects now only contain one set of bands.

* Added
  - CHANGELOG file
  - Exciton 2D maps, so to visualize exciton in the (ke, kh) space
  - Electron-hole continuum bands

* Improved
  - Exciton band dispersion now span the full helical BZ.

* Bugfix
  - Bug in the calculation of the helical reciprocal vectors: beta was wrong due to integer casting.


cntt 0.3 (2023 Mar 29)
---------------------------

* Added
  - DFT capabilities (outsourced to Quantum Espresso).
  - Fourier interpolation of k-points.

* Bugfix
  - Minor fixes.


cntt 0.2 (2022 Oct 28)
---------------------------

* Added
  - Package has been renamed to CNTT.
  - New logo.
  - New plotting features: labels, simultaneous multiple plots and comparison.
  - Density of States calculation (for both electron and excitons).
  - Basic doping capabilities: the choice of the fermi level and binding energy will reflect in the exciton band dispersion.

* Improved
  - Plot of the kpoint valley minima (takes into account valence and conduction bands).

* Bugfix
  - Minor fixes.


swcnt-bands 0.1 (2022 Sep 20)
---------------------------

* Added
  - Linear and helical unit cells.
  - Linear and helical Brillouin zones.
  - Linear and helical electron band structure.
  - Helical effective mass approximation of the dispersion relation of bright and dark singlet excitons.
