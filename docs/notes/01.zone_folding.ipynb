    "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are structures consisting of a graphene sheet rolled up into a cylinder.\n",
    "Generally, due to their small diameter compared to their length, CNTs are considered (quasi) one dimensional materials. Most of their properties are a consequence of the way the graphene sheet is rolled. We can have two types of CNTs (see Fig. 1):\n",
    " - **achiral** CNTs (further subdivided in armchair or zigzag CNTs),\n",
    " - and **chiral** CNTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/chiral.png\" alt=\"Chiral/Achiral CNTs\"/>\n",
    "<center>Fig. 1: Three examples of the graphene sheets that generate chiral and achiral CNTs.</center>\n",
    "<br\\><br\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every nanotube is uniquely defined by a pair of integer numbers $(n,m)$, $n \\ge m$. These are the coefficients of the so-called *chiral* vector $ \\mathbf{C} = n \\mathbf{a}_1 + m \\mathbf{a}_2$, where $\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\mathbf{a}_2$ are the basis lattice vectors of the underlying grpahene sheet.\n",
    "The $\\mathbf{C}$ vector runs over the circumference of the tube.\n",
    "The chirality of CNTs is:\n",
    " \n",
    " - $(n,n)$ armchair,\n",
    " - $(n,0)$ zigzag,\n",
    " - $(n,m)$ chiral.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic geometrical properties of CNTs\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given $(n,m)$ pair we define the following important quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "D &= \\text{gcd}(n,m) \\\\\n",
    "M &= (n - m) \\, \\text{mod} \\, (3 D) \\\\\n",
    "S &= (n - m) \\, \\text{mod} \\, 3 \\\\\n",
    "R &= \\text{gcd}(2n+m, 2m+n) \\\\\n",
    "N &= \\frac{2 (n^2 + nm + m^2)}{R}\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function $\\text{gcd}(x,y)$ returns the greatest common divisor between $x$ and $y$. The above quantities are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - $D$ counts the number of **unique rotations** (along the main axis) that leave the CNT the same. For example, the $(4,2)$ CNT in Fig. 1 has $D = 2$, which means that the CNT is not affected by rotations of 180 degrees.\n",
    " \n",
    " - $M$ can be any value in the range $\\{0, ..., 3D-1\\}$. When $M=0$ the nanotube is **metallic type 2**, M2. This corresponds to a band structure where a single helical subband crosses both Dirac points.\n",
    " - $S$ can be either 0, 1 or 2. If $M\\ne0$, CNTs with $S=0$ are **metallic type 1**, M1. Otherwise, when $S = 1$ or $S = 2$ the CNT is **semiconducting type 1**, S1, or **semiconducting type 2**, S2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Armchair** CNTs are always M2. **Zigzag** CNTs can be M1, S1 or S2. **Chiral** CNTs can be any type.\n",
    "\n",
    " - $R$ is closely related to $D$, $M$ and $S$: if $M=0$ then $R = 3D$, otherwise $R=D$.\n",
    " \n",
    " - finally, $N$ is the **number of hexagons** in the CNT unitcell. Since each hexagon contains 2 carbon atoms, the total number of carbon atoms per section of the tube is $2N$. For example, in the $(4,2)$ CNT above we have $N=28$, which means a total of $56$ carbon atoms.\n",

    "## CNT real and reciprocal space lattices\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the real and reciprocal space lattices of a CNT we must start from the underlying graphene lattice.\n",
    "To do this, we start by observing that the coloured shaded regions depicted in Fig. 1 define the **supercell** of the given CNT containing $2N$ atoms: this description is redundant.\n",
    "Any atom in a given CNT can be constructed by an appropriate roto-translation operation performed on the underlying 2-atom graphene unit cell. To be more precise, any 2-atom unit cell can be chosen to construct the full CNT.\n",
    "The procedure to build the entire CNT starting from a 2-atom unit cell goes under the name of **zone folding scheme**.\n",
    "In the following we will study 2 different zone folding schemes:\n",
    " - the **linear** construction,\n",
    " - and the **helical** construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fig. 2 shows both the linear and helical construction schemes for a $(4,2)$ CNT.\n",

In green is the 56-atom supercell, blue is the linear 2-atom unit cell, red is the helical 2-atom unit cell. b) Reciprocal space lattice. Blue and red are the linear and helical Brillouin zones. The supercell Brillouin zone is not drawn. The red solid lines are the electronic subbands. For the definition of the lattice vectors see the main text.</center>\n",
