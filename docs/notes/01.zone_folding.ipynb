    "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are structures consisting of a graphene sheet rolled up into a cylinder.\n",
    "Generally, due to their small diameter compared to their length, CNTs are considered (quasi) one dimensional materials. Most of their properties are a consequence of the way the graphene sheet is rolled. We can have two types of CNTs (see Fig. 1):\n",
    " - **chiral** CNTs (further subdivided in armchair or zigzag CNTs),\n",
    " - and **achiral** CNTs.\n",

    "Every nanotube is uniquely defined by a pair of integer numbers $(n,m)$, $n \\ge m$. These are the coefficients of the so-called *chiral* vector $ \\mathbf{C} = n \\mathbf{a}_1 + m \\mathbf{a}_2$, where $\\mathbf{a}_1$, $\\mathbf{a}_2$ are the basis lattice vectors of the underlying grpahene sheet.\n",
