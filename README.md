Utility to compute the electronic band structure of carbon nanotubes. It uses the well known tight binding approximation of CNTs and displays the band structure in linear and helical coordinates.

## Installation

Simply download or clone the package repository.

Requirements:

- `python 3.x`
- `numpy`

## Usage

Run the code from the terminal

`python swcnt-bands.py`

## Support
For any problems, questions or suggestions, please contact me at tenobaldi@gmail.com.

## Roadmap

Currently the project only supports computing and displaying the carbon nanotube band structure from the tight-binding zone-folding approximation. Future developments will include:

- optical matrix elements
- density of states
- doping
